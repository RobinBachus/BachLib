# BachLib

This is my personal library of useful functions and classes that I use for my C# projects. 
It is a work in progress and I will be adding to it as I go along.

## Current Features

### Logger

The Logger class allows unified logging to the console and/or to a file. 
It supports different log levels and has some formatting options like timestamps and log levels.
It can log colored messages on both Windows and Linux.

### Utils

The Utils class contains a collection of useful functions that I use in my projects.
For now it's just some formatting and converting functions.

### Extensions

The Extensions class contains a collection of extension methods that I use in my projects.
For now it's just some string extensions.

## Usage

*don't* :D

<sub><sup>
	They're all static classes so you can just call the functions directly. 👍
